// This only exists because I need a C++ file for `add_gfxtk_shader_library`
// Originally, I was able to get by with `add_library(target OBJECT ...)` for shader files but for Xcode (and I assume
// all other generators) it attempts to link those files WHEN IT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO. So my work around is now to do
// `add_library(target OBJECT shader_empty.cpp ...)`
// TODO: It _might_ be possible to use this to further benefit users by outputting source and header files that
// TODO: predefine shaders and loaders for those shaders for the user... idk.
